# olx_parser
This script created for parsing sections of OLX.ua
It is copying title, price, address and link of every offer in section of site and writing it into file.
"requests" was used to send request to server and recieve its answer.
"BeautifulSoup" was used to interpretate server's answer into analyzable html-code for further work.
"Pandas" was used to structure the result data into .csv-file for comfortable interaction.
You can switch the section of marketplace by choosing the correct number of it in the beginning of script's work.
Thanks for your attention :)
